# Edge Cases Discussion

## Overview
This document outlines edge cases considered during the design phase, clearly indicating which ones are handled in the implementation and which would be addressed in future iterations.

## Implemented Edge Cases

### 1. Network Interruptions During Audio Upload
- **Description**: Connection drops during audio chunk upload
- **Implementation**: 
  - Retry mechanism for failed uploads
  - Local buffering of chunks
  - Clear user feedback
  - Automatic resume on reconnection

### 2. Offline Note Taking
- **Description**: User loses connection while taking notes
- **Implementation**:
  - Local storage for notes
  - Sync queue for pending updates
  - Conflict resolution strategy
  - Connection status indicators

### 3. LLM Simulation Failures
- **Description**: Simulated LLM service failures
- **Implementation**:
  - Timeout handling
  - Error state management
  - Retry mechanisms
  - User feedback

## Considered but Not Implemented

### 1. Concurrent Session Access
- **Description**: Multiple users accessing same session
- **Rationale**: Outside MVP scope, single-user focus
- **Future Solution**: 
  - Implement session locking
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Conflict resolution

### 2. Large Audio Files
- **Description**: Sessions longer than 1 hour
- **Rationale**: Beyond current scope
- **Future Solution**:
  - Streaming processing
  - Chunked storage
  - Progressive loading

### 3. Complex Audio Scenarios
- **Description**: Background noise, multiple speakers
- **Rationale**: Not critical for demo
- **Future Solution**:
  - Noise reduction
  - Speaker identification
  - Audio cleanup

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- **Description**: Support for older browsers
- **Rationale**: Focus on modern browsers for MVP
- **Future Solution**:
  - Polyfills
  - Fallback mechanisms
  - Browser detection

### 5. Storage Management
- **Description**: Cleanup of temporary and abandoned session data
- **Rationale**: Not critical for demo environment
- **Future Solution**:
  - Automated cleanup policies
  - Session abandonment detection
  - Storage quota management
  - Data retention policies

## Discussion Points
- How would we prioritize implementing these edge cases?
- What additional edge cases might emerge in production?
- How would we handle edge cases specific to different user roles?
- What monitoring would help identify new edge cases?
