# Solution Overview

## Introduction
- **Purpose**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architectural decisions and setup for our audio processing application, aimed at enhancing user experience through efficient management of audio sessions and notes.
- **Scope**: The application covers functionalities from audio chunk processing and session management to notes linkage and summary generation, all within a robust local development environment.

## System Architecture
- **Overview**: The application is built using a modular monolith architecture with event-driven components for asynchronous processing.
- **Components**:
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express
    - Modular structure with dependency injection ready
    - Command pattern for business operations
    - Repository pattern for data access
  - **Event Processing**:
    - DynamoDB Streams for Change Data Capture (CDC)
    - SQS for reliable message queuing
    - Lambda functions for asynchronous audio processing
  - **Message Flow**:
    - Audio uploads trigger DynamoDB updates
    - CDC events flow through DynamoDB Streams
    - SQS queues manage transcription workload
  - **Frontend**: Next.js application
    - Server-side API routes for audio processing
    - Client-side chunk management
  - **Data Handling**: Utilizes DynamoDB and LocalStack for robust data management and storage solutions.

## Data Management
- **Domain Models**:
  - **ConsultationSession**: Core entity managing the consultation lifecycle
    - Tracks audio processing status
    - Manages audio chunks and notes
    - Handles session state (active/completed)
  - **AudioChunk**: Represents individual audio segments
    - Manages chunk metadata and processing state
    - Links to S3 storage
    - Tracks transcription status
  - **ConsultationNote**: Captures consultation annotations
    - Timestamped notes
    - Links to specific parts of the consultation

- **Database Configuration**:
  - **DynamoDB**: Used for its serverless nature and consistent performance
  - **Schema**: 
    - Primary Key: `id` (UUID)
    - GSI: `status` for querying active/completed sessions
- **Object Storage**:
  - **LocalStack**: Simulates AWS S3 and DynamoDB in local environment
  - **S3**: Handles chunked audio file storage

## Security Implementation
- **Authentication**:
  - Basic Auth with hardcoded credentials
  - Environment variable configuration in both frontend and backend
  - Health check endpoint bypass
  - Centralized auth via api.ts utility
  - Config-based credentials management

- **API Security**:
  - Request validation using Zod schemas
  - CORS and basic security headers
  - Command/Query pattern for input validation
  - Structured error responses

- **Development Setup**:
  - Default credentials for local development
  - Environment variable overrides
  - Logging of auth failures
  - Easy testing via Postman/curl

## Current Limitations and Future Work
- **Authentication & Security**:
  - Basic Auth sufficient for demo
  - Credentials need secure management
  - Rate limiting to be implemented
  - Token-based auth needed for production use

- **Testing Coverage**:
  - Unit test structure ready with dependency injection
  - Integration tests needed for event flows
  - E2E tests pending for frontend

- **Monitoring & Observability**:
  - Basic logging implemented
  - Needs metrics and tracing

## Development Environment
- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - Terraform for AWS resource provisioning
  - DynamoDB tables and streams
  - S3 buckets and permissions
  - Lambda functions and triggers
- **Local Development**:
  - LocalStack for AWS service emulation
    - S3 for audio storage
    - DynamoDB for session data
    - Lambda for event processing
  - Docker Compose for service orchestration
