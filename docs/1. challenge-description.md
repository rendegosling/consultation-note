# Challenge Description
Your task is to create a simplified version of a consultation note-taking application

## Objectives
Develop a single-page web application where users can:
- Start and stop recording a consultation session (audio recording)
- Add notes before and during the recording session. Doctors use notes to provide additional context, like their observations or things they do not want to share directly with the patient
- Generate a consultation note using LLM, once the recording is finished. The generated note should be generated based on the transcript of the conversation and the notes captured by the doctor

## Note
* You do not need to implement a real Large Language Model (LLM) client or use an actual data store. You can simulate these functionalities or use placeholders.
* You can use any framework you prefer
* You are allowed to use third-party libraries

## Focus Areas

### Front-End Engineering
If you prefer front-end development, focus on the application's design, user experience, and take into consideration the mobile view.

### Back-End Engineering
If you lean towards back-end development, concentrate on data processing, and reliability of the system.

## Submission Requirements
Before the in-person interview, please provide:
* Source Code: A complete version of your solution
* Setup Instructions: Clear guidelines on how to run the project locally
* Solution Overview: A brief explanation of your approach and architectural decisions

## Interview Agenda
During the interview, you will:
* Present Your Solution: Walk us through your application and its features
* Discuss Decisions and Assumptions: Explain the choices you made and any assumptions you relied on
* Explore Edge Cases: Identify edge cases you considered but didn't implement due to time constraints
* Production Release Strategy: Describe how you would deploy this feature to a production environment and monitor its behaviour

After that, we would brainstorm together follow-up solutions related to some of the problems we face in production.

## Key Outcomes
By completing this challenge, we aim to assess your ability to:
* Develop end-to-end solutions, attention to detail, and ability to think of and handle edge cases
* Effectively communicate approach, assumption and results
* Write clean, maintainable, and well-document code

## Additional Notes
* Feel free to make assumptions where necessary, but please document them
* If you have any questions during the challenge, please contact your POC
