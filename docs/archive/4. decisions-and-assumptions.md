# Architectural Decisions and Assumptions

## Key Decisions

### 1. Modular Monolith over Microservices
- **Decision**: Chose modular monolith architecture
- **Alternatives Considered**: Microservices, Traditional monolith
- **Rationale**: 
  - Simpler deployment for local development
  - Easier to maintain and test
  - Sufficient for current scale
  - Can be split into microservices later if needed

### 2. DynamoDB with Streams
- **Decision**: Use DynamoDB with Streams for data storage and CDC
- **Alternatives Considered**: PostgreSQL + Outbox, MongoDB
- **Rationale**:
  - Built-in CDC through DynamoDB Streams
  - Simplified event-driven architecture
  - Native integration with AWS services
  - Easy local development with LocalStack
  - Serverless and scalable
  - No need for separate outbox table
  - Single source of truth for data and events
  - Consistent performance characteristics

### 3. Chunked Audio Processing
- **Decision**: Process audio in chunks asynchronously via API
- **Alternatives Considered**: Real-time streaming, Process audio in chunks asynchronously via buffered SQS, Complete file upload
- **Rationale**:
  - Centralized control over authentication and validation
  - Simpler frontend implementation and error handling
  - Immediate feedback to users through API responses
  - Better handling of network issues through chunk-level retries
  - Easier integration with backend services and storage
  - Simplified monitoring and debugging through backend logs
  - More straightforward path to implement business logic and transformations
  - Reduced complexity compared to direct queue integration

### 4. Logging and Observability
- **Decision**: basic logging strategy with structured logs
- **Alternatives Considered**: Basic console logs, Third-party APM tools
- **Rationale**:
  - Frontend: Simple logger with context and levels
    - Tracks user interactions
    - Captures client-side errors
    - Helps debug upload issues
  - Backend: Winston provider with structured logging
    - Component-based logging (COMPONENT_NAME)
    - Consistent log format across services
    - Error tracking with stack traces
    - Request/Response logging for API calls
    - Business event logging for operations
    - Performance monitoring through timestamps
  - Benefits:
    - Easy to trace request flow
    - Quick debugging in development
    - Production-ready logging patterns
    - Facilitates log aggregation
    - Enables log-based monitoring
    - Helps identify performance bottlenecks

### 5. LLM Simulation
- **Decision**: Simple hardcoded template for consultation summary
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed template with basic medical consultation structure
  - Dynamic insertion of:
    - Session ID
    - Current date
    - User's notes
  - No delay simulation needed
  - No error scenarios implemented
  - Basic success/failure status tracking

## Key Assumptions (Implementation)

### 1. Scale and Performance
- Local development environment is sufficient for demonstration
- System will handle single-user scenarios effectively
- General API response times under 2 seconds are acceptable
- LLM simulation

### 2. Security
- Basic authentication is sufficient for demo
- Data encryption not required in local development
- CORS and basic security headers are adequate

### 3. Data Management
- Audio files will be relatively small (< 1 hour sessions)
- Text data will be minimal
- Temporary storage cleanup is not critical for demo
- LocalStack is sufficient for simulating S3 in development

### 4. Offline Functionality
- Audio recording requires active connection for chunk upload
- Notes can be saved locally when offline
- System will sync notes when connection restores
- Clear user feedback when connection is lost
- Basic error handling for connection recovery

### 5. LLM Simulation
- **Decision**: Simple hardcoded template for consultation summary
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed template with basic medical consultation structure
  - Dynamic insertion of:
    - Session ID
    - Current date
    - User's notes
  - No delay simulation needed
  - No error scenarios implemented
  - Basic success/failure status tracking

### Additional Assumptions
#### Audio Processing
- 15-second chunks are optimal for our use case
- Base Whisper model is sufficient for development
- Transcription delay of 0.5-1 second per chunk is acceptable
- Network can handle chunk upload within 3 seconds
#### Summary Generation
- Immediate response with template
- No processing delay
- Simple success/failure states

## Production Considerations (For Discussion)

### 1. Scaling Considerations
- Multi-user access patterns
- High availability requirements
- Performance optimization needs
- Load balancing strategies
- Rate limiting requirements:
  - Per-user upload limits
  - Chunk size and frequency limits
  - API endpoint throttling
  - DDoS protection considerations

### 2. Security Considerations
- Production authentication requirements, Oauth
- Data encryption needs
- Audit logging requirements
- Compliance standards

### 3. Operational Considerations
- Monitoring and alerting strategies
- SLA requirements
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery strategies

## Questions for Discussion
- How would this architecture scale in a production environment?
- What security measures would be needed for consultation data?
- How would we handle multi-user scenarios?
- What monitoring would be needed in production?
- How would we handle data retention and compliance requirements?
- What would be the strategy for database migrations in production?
- How would we implement zero-downtime deployments?
- What would be our strategy for transitioning from LLM simulation to real LLM service in production? 

## LLM Integration Approaches

### 1. Direct API Calls to LLM
- **Characteristics**:
  - Simple request/response pattern
  - Single prompt, single response
  - Stateless interactions
  - Direct control over prompts
- **Use Cases**:
  - Text completion
  - Simple summarization
  - Direct translations
  - Basic Q&A
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  async function generateSummary(text: string): Promise<string> {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "Summarize this medical consultation"
      }, {
        role: "user",
        content: text
      }]
    });
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  }
  ```

### 2. AI Agents
- **Characteristics**:
  - Multi-step reasoning
  - Tool/function usage
  - Memory and context management
  - Autonomous decision making
- **Use Cases**:
  - Complex workflows
  - Multi-step analysis
  - Interactive tasks
  - Context-aware processing
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  class MedicalConsultationAgent {
    private memory: ConversationMemory;
    private tools: Tool[];
    
    async analyzeMedicalConsultation(session: ConsultationSession) {
      // 1. Analyze audio transcript
      const transcript = await this.tools.transcriptAnalyzer.analyze();
      
      // 2. Extract key medical terms
      const terms = await this.tools.medicalTermExtractor.extract();
      
      // 3. Cross-reference with medical knowledge base
      const references = await this.tools.knowledgeBase.search(terms);
      
      // 4. Generate structured summary
      return this.generateStructuredSummary(transcript, terms, references);
    }
  }
  ```
