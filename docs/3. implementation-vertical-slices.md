# Implementation Vertical Slices

## Core MVP Features (Challenge Requirements)

## 1. Basic Audio Recording and Storage
- Setup basic project structure with Docker Compose
- Implement audio recording with 15-second chunks
  - Browser-based recording with memory buffer
  - Immediate chunk upload
  - More frequent progress updates
- Setup PostgreSQL for session management
- Configure LocalStack for audio storage
- Configure local Whisper service (base model)
- Basic error handling for failed uploads
- Simple logging for development

**Value**: Users can record audio sessions with reliable chunking and storage.

## 2. Session Management and Notes
- Implement session creation/management
- Add notes functionality with timestamps
- Setup auto-save for notes
- Add session status tracking
- Enhanced error handling for data consistency

**Value**: Users can create sessions and take notes during recordings.

## 3. Audio Processing and Transcription
- Implement chunk processing pipeline
  - 15-second chunk size optimization
  - Parallel processing capability
  - Frequent progress tracking
- Add Whisper-based transcription
  - Local Docker instance
  - Base model for development
  - REST API integration
- Link transcriptions to timestamps
- Enhance error recovery for processing failures
- Add progress tracking

**Value**: Users can see transcriptions of their recordings with minimal delay and frequent updates.

## 4. Summary Generation
- Implement LLM simulation with templated responses
- Add summary viewing/editing capabilities
- Link summaries to sessions
- Setup export functionality
- Enhanced error handling for generation failures
- Simulate common LLM failure scenarios

**Value**: Users can generate and manage summaries of their sessions with predictable behavior for testing.

## Enhanced Features (Development Quality)

## 5. Enhanced Monitoring and Reliability
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for local development
  - Set up basic OpenTelemetry collector in Docker Compose
  - Add essential tracing for audio processing pipeline
  - Configure basic metrics for development debugging
  - Implement structured logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add basic performance monitoring dashboards

**Value**: Basic observability during development to help with debugging and understanding system behavior.
